lsblk: list block devices
mount: (sudo only)
       ex: mkdir mountpoint1
           sudo mount device_from_lsblk mountpoint1
       (can now access device_from_lsblk at mountpoint1,
        such as usb etc)
umount


shuf->shuffle lines in a file (ex training list)


variables truncation:
${varname:startpos:runlength}

ie:
  >>>a='i wub u'
  >>>echo ${a:2:3}
  wub


${!VAR}: dereference VAR and treat that as the variable name
ex:
    >>>a=b
    >>>c=a
    >>>echo ${!c}
    b
(same as echo ${a})
