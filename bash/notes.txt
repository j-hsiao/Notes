Macro to run script in vim and replace with the output, ignoring comments.
"<key>y to load into a register

use visual mode to select the script to run then @<key> to replace with the result.

:!bash -c 'while read -r line; do if [[ "${line}" \!= "\#"* ]]; then echo "${line}"; eval "${line}"; fi; done'

	-0.0- arithmetic expressions
	Arithmetic expressions are expressions that will be evaluated in an arithmetic context.
	These include:
		$((here))
		((here))
		variable_name[here]

	Arithmetic expressions can contain the usual numbers, parentheses, operators, but also
	variables.  Variables will be recursively expanded until empty or no more variables.
	Variables are expanded individually meaning they are not expanded into text.
	This matters when a variable contains an expr.  Parameter expansion happens before
	arithmetic expansion.

	example:
		a=1
		b=2
		c='a+b'
		d='a + b + c

		expression  result  analysis
		$((d))      6       d = (c + a + b) = ((a + b) + (1) + (2)) = (((1) + (2)) + (1) + (2)) = ((1 + 2) + 1 + 2) = (3 + 1 + 2) = 6
		$((d * 2))  12      d * 2 = (c + a + b) * 2 = ((a + b) + (1) + (2)) * 2 = (((1) + (2)) + (1) + (2)) * 2 = ((1 + 2) + 1 + 2)*2 = 6*2 = 12
		$(($d * 2)) 12      a + b + c * 2 = (1) + (2) + (a+b) * 2 = 1 + 2 + ((1) + (2)) * 2 = 3 + 3 * 2 = 3 + 6 = 9

	______________________________
	-0.1- logic
		every command has an exit code.  The exit code determines truthiness.
		0 = true, nonzero = false.  The exitcode for the last process can be
		obtained with $?

		if command; then <do stuff; and more stuff; ...;> fi

		while command; do <stuff; and morestuff; ...;> done

		for var in <sequence of items by ifs>; do <stuff; and more stuff...;> done

		case <pat> in
			pat)
				stuffs
				;; (break)
			pat)
				stuffs
				;& (fall through, only bash 4.0+)
			*)
				etc
		esac
		(see -0.4- pattern matching)
	______________________________
	-0.2- variables
		general note:
			using * and @ result in all relevant items.
			However, putting the thing into double quotes,
			* becomes a single item whereas @ preserves
			identity of each item
			eg:
				a=("this" "contains" "something with a space")
				printf '# %s\n' "${a[@]}"
				# this
				# contains
				# something with a space
				printf '# %s\n' "${a[*]}"
				# this contains something with a space

			if parameter is array-like, operations are usually
			applied to each item in the array

		creation:
			declare varname
			varname=value

			NOTE: declare will create a local variable if called in function scope.

				example1:
					somescript:
						declare -A myvar

					func() {
						. somescript
						# Even though the declare is in script scope in its own script,
						# if sourced from inside a function, then it becomes function
						# scope.
					}

					# myvar does not exist
					func
					# myvar still does not exist
					# The script is sourced inside a function so the declare
					# ends up as function scope
					. somescript
					# now myvar exists.




		creation from other var
			printf format string and save under var name
				printf -v "${variable_containing_target_name}" 'format_string' args...
			read with herestring
				read [flags...] "${variable_containing_target_name}" <<<"string to save to var"
		deletion:
			unset varname

		______________________________
		-0.2.0- expansions
			______________________________
			-0.2.0.1- normal expansion
				${varname}

				quoting the variable will make it a single token

					Without quoting:
						input:              output
						x='hello world'     hello
						printf '%s\n' ${x}  world

					with quoting:
						input:                  output:
						x='hello world'         hello world
						printf '%s\n' "${x}"

				Arrays are expanded with indices:
					${array[idx]}     The indexed item, idx is an arithmetic expr
					${array[@]}       All items, separate if double-quoted, preserves spaces.
					${array[*]}       All items, single str if double-quoted

				example:
					a=(a b 'c d' 1)
					printf '# %s\n' "${a[0]}"
					# a
					printf '# %s\n' "${a[a[3]]}"
					# b
					printf '# %s\n' ${a[@]}
					# a
					# b
					# c
					# d
					# 0
					printf '# %s\n' ${a[*]}
					# a
					# b
					# c
					# d
					# 0
					printf '# %s\n' "${a[@]}"
					# a
					# b
					# c d
					# 0
					printf '# %s\n' "${a[*]}"
					# a b c d 0

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.2- length expansion
				${#param}       number of characters
				${#param[@]}    number of items in array

				x=(a 'b c' d)
				echo '#' ${#x}
				# 1
				echo '#' ${#x[@]}
				# 3
				echo '#' ${#x[*]}
				# 3
				echo '#' "${#x}"
				# 1
				echo '#' "${#x[@]}"
				# 3
				echo '#' "${#x[*]}"
				# 3
			______________________________
			-0.2.0.3- indirect expansion
				${!varContainingVarName}
					NOTE: only 1 level of indirection is allowed
					save to tempvariable and reuse for more levels
					It does NOT work on arrays

				Quoting makes the expansion a single value
					x='with space'
					y=x
					printf '# %s\n' ${!y}
					# with
					# space
					printf '# %s\n' "${!y}"
					# with space

				The alternative is to use a name reference (actually works with arrays too)
					(bash >= 4.3)
					[declare|local] -n var=actualvarname

					example:
						x=('with space' a b)
						declare -n y=x
						printf '# %s\n' "${y[@]}"
						# with space
						# a
						# b

					# does not work with arrays...
					# only works with the first item of array, using array as a normal variable.
						x=('with space' a b)
						z=x
						printf '# %s\n' "${!z}"
						# with space
						printf '# %s\n' "${!z[0]}"
						# with space
						printf '# %s\n' "${!z[1]}"
						# 

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.4- existence/empty expansion
				replace WITH THE EXPANSION (quirks with quoting) if empty/unset or non-empty/set

				${[expr1][:][op][expr2]}
					op:
						-    replace with expr2 if empty/unset
						=    replace and assign if empty/unset
						?    print expr2 as error message if empty/unset
						+    replace with expr2 if not set/non-empty
					:
						check emptiness instead of unset-ness

				expr1:
					arrvar[@]: For arrays, :- and :+ are the same as - and +
					           (only looks at effective length, does not matter if the array variable exists or not.)
					var: Check if the var exists and/or is empty

				From testing, this has some weird interactions with quoting
				set -x
				x=
				printf '# %s\n' ${x:-a b c}
				# a
				# b
				# c
				printf '# %s\n' "${x:-a b c}"
				# a b c
				printf '# %s\n' ${x:-"a b c"}
				# a b c
				printf '# %s\n' ${x:-'a b c'}
				# a b c
				printf '# %s\n' "${x:-'a b c'}"
				# 'a b c'
				printf '# %s\n' "${x:-'"a b c"'}"
				# 'a b c'
				printf '# %s\n' "${x:-'a b c"'}"
				# 'a b c'

				x=()
				y=(a b c)
				printf '# %s\n' ${x[@]:-${y[@]}}
				# a
				# b
				# c
				printf '# %s\n' ${x[@]:-"${y[@]}"}
				# a
				# b
				# c
				printf '# %s\n' "${x[@]:-${y[@]}}"
				# a
				# b
				# c
				printf '# %s\n' ${x[@]:-${y[*]}}
				# a
				# b
				# c
				printf '# %s\n' ${x[@]:-"${y[*]}"}
				# a b c
				printf '# %s\n' "${x[@]:-${y[*]}}"
				# a b c

				COMP_WORDBREAKS="${COMP_WORDBREAKS:-$' \t\n\\\"\\\'><=;|&(:'}"
				?? TODO: explain this...

				It ALMOST seems like the entire ${...}
				gets replaced by expr2 and then everything
				is re-evaluated, except for when working with nested quotes.
				(internal double quotes seem to be tossed, but still parsed)

				consistent with direct replacement:
					${x:-a b c} -> a b c
					"${x:-a b c}" -> "a b c"
					${x:-"a b c"} -> "a b c"
					${x:-'a b c'} -> 'a b c'
					"${x:-'a b c'}" -> "'a b c'"
					"${x:-\"a b c\"}" -> "\"a b c\""

				tossed double quotes:
					"${x:-'"a b c"'}" -> "'a b c'"
					"${x:-'"a b c'}" -> "'a b c'"
				still parsed even if tossed:
					"${x:-'a b c}" -> asks for more input
					"${x:-"a b c}" -> asks for more input

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.5- slicing expansion
				String slicing:
					${param:offset[:length]}
						offset/length are arithmetic expressions and expanded as such
						negative values are indices from end of var
						if length is negative, it is taken as a stop position (excluded)

					x=0123456789
					echo "# ${x:0:3}"
					# 012
					echo "# ${x: -5:3}"
					# 567
					echo "# ${x: -5:-2}"
					# 567

				NOTE: for negative offset, a space is required to disambiguate
				between emptiness expansion and slicing.
				ie:
					${x:-3} -> 3 if x is empty, else ${x}
					${x: -3} -> x sliced starting at 3 characters from the back.

			Array slicing:
				Same as string slicing, except negative length is NOT allowed.
				have to do calculate the desired length.
				? is this because indices don't need to be contiguous ?

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.6- key/idx/prefix expansion
				${!prefix*}
				${!prefix@}
					sequence of varnames that begin with prefix

				${!arrname[@]}
				${!arrname[*]}
					sequence of keys/indices for the arrays

				quoting:
					Same as normal array expansion.

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.7- deletion expansion
				see also -0.4- pattern matching
				${param#pattern}        delete from beginning (shortest)
				${param##pattern}       delete from beginning (longest)
				${param%pattern}        delete from end (shortest)
				${param%%pattern}       delete from end (longest)

				quoting:
					Variables within pattern are expanded before the
					pattern is evaluated.  Use quotes to protect variables from being
					interpreted.

					example:
						x=*a
						y='*awhatever goodbye'
						echo "# ${y##${x}}"     # -> ${y##*a}, removes all characters up to and including a
						# tever goodbye
						echo "# ${y##"${x}"}"   # -> ${y##"*a"}, removes literal *a
						# whatever goodbye

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.8- substitution expansion
				like regex but pattern matching instead
				${parameter/pattern/replacement}        single replacement
				${parameter//pattern/replacement}       global replacement
				${parameter/#pattern/replacement}       at beginning
				${parameter/%pattern/replacement}       at end

				If the /replacement is omitted, matches are deleted instead (replaced with empty str)

				quoting:
					x=[a-z]
					y=a1b2[a-z]
					echo "# ${y//${x}/9}"         # ${y//[a-z]/9}, replace all lowercase with 9
					# 9192[9-9]
					echo "# ${y//"${x}"/9}"       # ${y//"[a-z]"/9}, replace all '[a-z]' with 9
					# a1b29
					echo "# ${y//[a-z]/9}"        # replace all lowercase with 9
					# 9192[9-9]
					echo "# ${y//['a'-'z']/9}"    # replace all lowercase with 9
					# 9192[9-9]
					echo "# ${y//['a-z']/9}"      # replace the 3 character a, -, z with 9
					# 91b2[999]

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.9- case expansion
				${parameter^pattern}
				${parameter^^pattern}
				${parameter,pattern}
				${parameter,,pattern}

				pattern should match a single-char, and if omitted, defaults to ?
				Matches are converted.

				examples:
					x='hello'
					y='ASDF'
					echo "# ${x^}"
					# Hello
					echo "# ${x^^}"
					# HELLO
					echo "# ${x^^[aeiou]}"
					# hEllO
					echo "# ${y,}"
					# aSDF
					echo "# ${y,,}"
					# asdf

			______________________________
			-0.2.0.10- operator expansions
				${parameter@operator}

				U      lowercase alphabetic characters converted to uppercase.
				u      the first character converted to uppercase, if it is alphabetic.
				L      uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
				Q      quoted in a format that can be reused as input.
				E      backslash escape sequences expanded as with the $'...' quoting
				       mechanism.
				P      expand the value of parameter as if it were a prompt string
				A      An assignment statement or declare command that, if evaluated,
				       will recreate parameter with its attributes and value.
				K      Produces a possibly-quoted version of the value of parameter,
				       except that it prints the values of indexed and associative
				       arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs
				a      The expansion is a string consisting of flag values representing
				       parameter's attributes.

		______________________________
		-0.2.1- scopes
			Scope determines where variables are visible.
			In general, there are 3 observed scopes.
			1: local
			   Local variables only exist for functions.  They
			   can only be seen within the function where they were
			   created as well as by any functions called from there.
			2: global
			   Global variables are seen everywhere.  They can be
			   shadowed by other variables.

			Assignment scopes:
				Assignments seem to search up the call stack and find the first
				instance (if it exists) of the variable with the same name until
				it hits global scope.

				example2:
					outer()
					{
						local localvar
						inner
					}
					innest() {
					}
					outer

				local assignment:
					local assignment always results in a local variable:
						local var=value     (only within a function)
						declare var=value   (if within a function)
					ex:
					inner() { local var=val; innest; }
					var is visible:
						1. within innest
						2. within inner, after local var=val;

					Note, local variables can exist on multiple levels.
					ex. outer() { local var; inner; }
					inner() { local var; }
					the var in inner is a different local variable to the var in outer.

				global assignment:
					Always results in global variable, will not modify any local
					variables.
						declare -g var=val
						declare var=val (if outside a function)

					inner() { declare -g var=val; innest; }
					var is visible:
						1. within innest
						2. within inner, after declare -g var=val
						3. within outer after inner
						4. within the script, after outer

				natural assignment:
					Natural assignments will assign to the first local variable looking
					through ancestor scopes.  If none are found, then the variable will
					become global.
					examples:
						var=val
						eval "${varname}=${val}"
						printf -v "${varname}" '%s...' "$[val}" ...
						read "${varname}" <<<"${val}"
						declare -n ref="${varname}"; ref="${val}"
							NOTE: 'ref' is a name reference variable. ref itself is a local
							variable, but varname, the referenced name will be assigned
							naturally

					ex1:
						inner() { var=val; innest; }
						var is visible:
							1. within innest
							2. within inner, after var=val
							3. within outer, after inner
							4. within the script, after outer

					ex2:
						inner() { localvar=val; innest; }
						var is visible:
							1. within innest
							2. within inner, after localvar=val
							3. within outer, (note that changes by inner will be visible
							   after the inner call)

		______________________________
		-0.2.2- strings
			operations
				version 5.1+
					${var@op}
						ops:
							U to uppercase
							u capitalized
							L to lowercase
							Q quoted format (like printf %q)
							E expand backslash escape sequences
							P expand as if prompt string
							A creation command to recreate the var
							K same as Q except arrays->quoted key value pairs
							a "string consisting of flag values representing parameter's attributes"

		______________________________
		-0.2.3- numbers

		______________________________
		-0.2.4- arrays
			Arrays act as their first item if no indexes.

			index arrays (int keys)
				creation:
					name[subscript]=value           create array+initialize single value
					declare -a name                 create empty array
					declare -a name[subscript]      same as above
					name=(val1 val2 val3 ...)       create/initialize array
					name=([key]=val [key]=val)      if key omitted, then place val
					                                after previous item in list
			expansion
				Expand arrays by indexing with [@] or [*]
				ex:
					${arr[@]}
					${arr[*]}
				If unquoted, normal word-splitting is used.
				If quoted, * results in a single string of items joined by space.
				           @ results in multiple arguments, one per index.

			adding items
				arr+=(stuff to append to arr)

			associative arrays (str keys)
				declare -A name                   associative array
				name=(key val key val...)         odd number assumes last value is empty str
				name=([key]=val [key]=val)

			indexing:
				subscripts are treated as arithmetic expressions
					ex:
						a=1
						${arr[a]} is the same as ${arr[$a]}
				(as if within $[])
				@ as subscript = all (separate words) * = all(single word)
				(index arrays only)
					negative indices are incremented by maxidx+1 (-1 = last item)

			getting info:
				get keys/idxs:
					${!arr[@]}
				get number of items (regardless of contiguity)
					${#arr[@]}

			deleting items
				unset arr[idxOrKey]

		______________________________
		-0.2.5- ANSI-C quoting
			Not really a variable, but putting it here because similar syntax
			Ansi quoted strings:
				escapes:
					$'\escape'
					ex:
						$'\r\n'
				byte:
					$'\ooo'         octal (1-3 digits)
					$'\xhh'         hex (1-2 digits)
					$'\uhhhh'       unicode hex (1-4 digits)
					$'\Uhhhhhhhh'   unicode hex (1-8 digits)
				control sequence:
					$'\cx'          control+x

		______________________________
		-0.2.6- special variables
		Bash has some special variables defined/?updated? by bash:
		SHLVL           The number of nested bash shells
		FUNCNAME        Array of functions being run. This is like a stack trace, 0 = current, 1 = parent, etc
		BASH_SOURCE     Array of source files per function in FUNCNAME
		BASH_REMATCH    Array of (fullregexmatch, group1, group2, ...)
		EPOCHREALTIME   floating point timestamp
		EPOCHSECONDS    seconds precision timestamp


	______________________________
	-0.3- functions
		defining functions:
			[function] funcname() {
				body
			}
			(function keyword is optional)

		functions run in the current shell (its variables will bleed out
		to caller, unless declared as local)
			arguments are same as scripts, ${1-9}, ${@}, shift, etc

		______________________________
		-0.3.1- function outputs
			Functions do not have an explicit output method.
			The `return` keyword for functions gives the function's exit code.
			There are various methods to return a value:
				(useful source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55331060)

				1. echo and use command substitution.
				   funcname() { echo result; }
				   output=$(funcname args...)
				   echo "${output}"

				2. fixed variable
				   Use a fixed variable name as the function output.  This is
				   also a simple solution but might result in name clashes.

					 funcname() { FIXED_OUTPUT_VAR=result; }
					 funcname
					 output="${FIXED_OUTPUT_VAR}"
					 echo "${output}"

				3. Use an associative array and output to a key.

				   declare -A OUTPUTS_ARRAY
				   funcname() { OUTPUTS_ARRAY["${1}"]=result; }
				   funcname output
				   echo ${OUTPUTS_ARRAY['output']}

				4. Use an variable output variable
				   Pass the name of the output variable to the function.  The
				   function sets the value.

					4.1 printf (bash version 3.1)
					    the -v argument will set the variable to the result
					    instead of printing to stdout.

					    funcname() { printf -v "${1}" "%s" result; }
					    funcname output
					    echo "${output}"

					4.2 read
					    read already saves to variable but uses stdin.  Use a
					    herestring.  NOTE: herestrings automatically add a
					    newline.  If the result might have a newline then extra
					    processing might be needed.

					    funcname() { IFS=$'\n' read "${1}" <<<result; }
					    funcname output
					    echo "${output}"

					4.3 declare (bash version 4.3)
					    The -n argument creates a nameref.  Use the nameref to
					    assign the values.  Note that the output var name must not
					    clash with the internal nameref variable name or a
					    circular reference will be created.

					    funcname() { declare -n out="${1}"; out=result; }
					    funcname output
					    echo "${output}"


			Comparisons:
				safety:
					Variable output variables all have code injection
					vulnerability.  Setting the output variable to
					'x[$(injected code here)]' will cause the injected code to
					run, but built-in read already has this vulnerability as well,
					so maybe it's acceptable/can be ignored?

					The fixed output varnames/echo methods do not have this issue.

				speed:
					fixed variable output is the fastest followed by array.
					Next is printf/declare, then read, and lastly echo.
					echo method uses IO as well as subshells so is the slowest.
					read uses IO so is slower than the others.

				nameclashes:
					echo has no name clashes since there are no variables.
					Fixed output might have name clashes.  Variable output
					vars can avoid name clashes as long as the right variable
					is chosen.

				The fixed output var method is the output method for
				programmable bash completion (COMPREPLY etc) so maybe this is
				generally the best choice?

	-0.6- brace expansion
		brace expansion generates sequences and is performed FIRST
		before anything else
		{a,b,...}:    repeat expression replacing with each a,b,...
		{a..b[..c]}:  iterate from a to b with step c if given, else 1
		              negative values work, step is abs-valued and direction
		              is determined by a to b.  {0..-10..2} will expand to
		              0, -2, -4 ... -10 bounds are inclusive.
		              prefixing with 0 will cause 0-padding for numbers
		ie:
		ls /some/dir/{a,*.x} -> ls /some/dir/a /some/dir/*.x
		and then /some/dir/*.x will be globbed

		nesting is allowed:
			{a{1..3},b{2..3}} -> a1 a2 a3 b2 b3
	______________________________
	-0.7- configuration files
		LOGIN shell: login from somewhere else
			/etc/profile
			first of:
				~/.bash_profile
				~/.bash_login
				~/.profile

		else if NON-LOGIN interactive shell: takes user input
			reads the .bashrc

		ONLY 1 file is sourced.
		the login files generally should set up the environment.
		interactive (.bashrc) should set up interaction:
			color
			aliases
		Because only 1 is sourced, login shells do not automatically
		source .bashrc even if they are also interactive.  This is why
		.profile/.bash_profile by default usually source .bashrc.

		summary:
			in .bashrc: check if interactive, return otherwise:
				[ -z "${PS1}" ] && return
					or
				[[ "$-" = *i* ]] || return
			in .profile, set your environment vars and add:
				if [ "$BASH" ] && [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
			In .bash_profile you can just source .profile, add any
				bash-unique settings or whatever.  Otherwise, you could also
				just delete this since .profile will be used in that case.

		read varname
			useful options:
				-u(fd)  read from filedescriptor instead (needs to end with
				        delimeter (default newline))
		readarray arrayname
			read items into an array
			useful options:
				-t  trim the delimiter

		heredocs
			someCommand << FILE_DELIMITER_OF_YOUR_CHOICE
			text etc

			$var1
			FILE_DELIMITER_OF_YOUR_CHOICE

			NOTE:
				if vars are in quotes, will not expand

			    use echo -n if you don't want that

		command substitution
			`command`
			$(command)

		process substitution
			<(bash script)   treat output of command as a file/stream

		syntax:
			[dst][direction] [src]
				dst:
					blank:        defaults to stdin if reading, stdout if writing
					fd
					{varname}     if opening: allocate an fd>10 and assign to varname
					              if closing: close the fd named by varname
					              redirection persists past command
					              (must manually manage)
				direction:
				    <           read
				    >           write
				    >|          clobber write
				    &>          both stderr and stdout
				    >>          append data
				    &>>         append both stderr and stdout
				    <>          both input/output (use > to close)
				    <<[-]word   heredoc, word is delimiter. If with -, ignore leading TABS
				    <<<         herestring

				src:
					${varname}    value of var
					filename
					&fd
					&${var}     value of var as fd
					&-    (closes the dst)
					&fd-  move the file descriptor
						NOTE: spaces are allowed between & and the following value
						    but not before.
					special filenames:
						/dev/stdin
						/dev/stdout
						/dev/stderr
						/dev/fd/<fd>
						/dev/tcp/host/port
						/dev/udp/host/port
		examples:
			{fd}<>myfile      open myfile for reading and save to variable "fd"
			>&"${fd}"         use fd as stdout
			{fd}<&-           close fd

		Create redirection in the current shell:
			exec <redirection expression>
		NOTE: while, for, if, until blocks can also have redirection
		      just add the redirection after the closing line of the block

			SRC>DEST
				SRC:
					& : stdout and stderr
					FD: a filedescriptor (0-9)
					empty : defaults to 1 (stdout)
				DEST:
					FNAME : a file name
					&FD   : to file descriptor
		______________________________
		input
			DEST<SRC
				DEST:
					FD : a file descriptor (0-9) for the file

				1 is stdout, 2 is stderr
				1 redirects to 2 (which is currently stderr)
				2 redirects to something (a file)
				processes' stdout goes to stderr and stderr goes to something
			2>something 1>2
				1 is stdout, 2 is stderr
				2 redirects to something
				1 redirects to 2, (which is currently something)

	-0.11- traps
	Bash has the trap command which allows executing a given script
	on some condition which is usually receiving a signal (SIG*).
	There are special sigspecs which are DEBUG, EXIT, ERR, and RETURN.

	trap - sigspec will "reset to its original value".
	From the man page:
		"each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the
		value it had upon entrance to the shell)"

	However, for RETURN, it seems like it returns upon entrance to
	the function instead of entrance to the shell.

	This means that trap can be used as a "finally" clause
	ex:
		myfun() {
			trap 'my cleanup; trap - RETURN' RETURN
		}
	If RETURN already had a trap upon entering myfun, then after exiting myfun,
	the RETURN trap will be restored to its original value (before entering)
	If the extra '; trap - RETURN' was not given inside myfun, then any trap
	specification inside myfun will override the trap going into myfun

-2- completion
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html
	code into ~/.bash_completion
	use command name to determine completion for arguments

	Note that command name can also be an alias to activate completions
	for same command under different situations by using an alias instead.

	completion priority order:
		1:
			if empty:
				use any with -E option
			if a path:
				use for corresponding path
				use any with -D option
		2: glob expansions
		3: -w options (split by IFS, expanded etc)
		4: functions with -F invoked
		5: functions with -C invoked
		6: filtered with -X option
		7: prefix/suffix from -P and -S added to candidates
		8: if no candidates, -o dirnames supplied to complete,
			directory completion attempted

				!       show-all-if-ambiguous
				@       show-all-if-unmodified
			functions only:
				COMP_WORDS: array of current commandline
				COMP_CWORD: index of current word in COMP_WORDS
				COMPREPLY : the completion candidates
				            An empty string will be completed as if it is the
				            same as the current word except when displayed,
				            for example, by show-all-if-ambiguous or multitab.
				            Any non-empty string will replace current word.
				            Duplicates will be merged into a single value.
				            The empty string shares a prefix with all other
				            strings(empty prefix).  As a result, no change in the
				            current word will happen if empty string is in
				            the list with some other non-empty string.
				            Thus, returning COMPREPLY=('' ' ') act like the 'p' case
				            in the above table and the displayed choices are all
				            blank/invisible.  The prompt will also be redrawn.

				            ex:
				            COMPREPLY=('')
				                current word is completed as is (adds a space if nospace is not set)
				                note that it DOES NOT replace the current word with nothing.
				            COMPREPLY=(' ')
				                current word is replaced with a single space
				            COMPREPLY=('' ' ')
				                current word is unchanged, may display an empty line printing out
				                the 2 choices: '' and ' '

				            ANSI keycodes in COMPREPLY are printed as visible chars
				            ex. escape ($'\e') will be printed as '^['
			NOTE
				When determining how to complete the current word, sometimes
				context is required.
				${2} will be the raw text on the command line, including backslashes.
				COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD] is also the raw text on command line, but it will also include
				any context (ex. starting quote)

				examples:               ${1}            COMP_CWORDS
					$(\(paren\)asdf[tab]  \(paren\)asdf   $(\(paren\)asdf
					"$(\(paren\)asdf[tab] $(\(paren\)asdf "$(\(paren\)asdf
					"$(\(paren\)as[tab]df $(\(paren\)as   "$(\(paren\)asdf

				To determine/expand anything to calculate completions, some context
				is probably required... ex, single or double string? or no context?
				Using COMP_CWORDS, the whole word is included even if the cursor is in
				the middle of the word.  ${1} makes a guess about what is the actual
				item to perfom completion on, but leaves out some potentially crucial
				contextual info... ex: '${HOME}/[tab] should not be completed ?since it is
				a single-quote? but "${HOME}/[tab]" can be completed no problem...??

		-G pat expand for completions
		-P: prefix prepended to completion results
		-S: suffix to append to completion results
		-W 'wordlist' (split by IFS)
			list of words split by IFS to be used as completion
			"Shell quoting is honored within the string, in order to provide a
			mechanism for the words to contain shell metacharacters or characters
			in the value of IFS. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion,
			tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution,
			and arithmetic expansion, as described above (see Shell Expansions)."
			basically, can use variables to avoid IFS clashes

			a=$(printf 'hello\nworld')
			-W '"${a}" other words'-> 3 items
				1: hello
				world
				2: other
				3: words
			sidenote: IFS=\n ->
				IFS='
				'
				IFS=$'\n'
				IFS=$(printf '\n\b')
		-X: remove matches to pattern
			prepend with a ! to remove non-matches
			& is substituted with curword (escape with a \ for literal &)
	NOTE:
		pats (-G, -W, -X) should be quoted

	example using -F method:
		compfunc () {
		    do stuff
		}
		complete -o filenames -o nospace -o bashdefault -F compfunc cd

	-6.1- printf
	printf using a format and arguments.
	undocumented:
		Convert a character into an int/unicode code point
		Use the %d/%i, argument should be single quote followed
		by a character.  Only the first character is converted.
		Other characters are ignored.
		eg.
			printf '%d' "'c"
			99

			somevar='hello'
			printf '%i' "'${somevar}"
			104

			printf '%i' "'你"
