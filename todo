1. ydo script
2. bash numeric completion
   a. shparse
   b. completion
3. vim modify alignment, [fF] ch,
   like normal mode [fF] except use previous line(s) position.
4. cppy
   cpp reference <-> py borrowed reference
   cpp value     <-> py owned reference
   clarify inheritance patterns etc...
   owned reference should be borrowed references except with extra
   cleanup (decref) on destructor...
   maybe separate constructor to create owned reference rather than
   borrowed reference?
5. ipc server using generator, yield/.send()
   1. separate polling handling/(buffered) reading etc with the handling
   2. separate thread handles polling and reading/writing.
   3. io should be non-blocking.
   4. use edge polling.
   5. should read/write actions be registered together or separately?
6. decorator style tkinter
   1. minimize function registration.
   2. focus more on tcl realities
   3. Tk.createcommand() creates a tcl command that calls corresponding python
      command, any arguments are passed in order, as str.
   4. maybe no bound methods? take id(self) and pass the id as the first
      (bound method's __self__ attr?)
      argument?, keep a dict of all instances...
      __del__ to remove list of instances...
