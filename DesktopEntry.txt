------------------------------
-0- general
------------------------------
NOTE: You can probably create one via GUI by right clicking on the desktop...

Desktop entries are used like icons for ubuntu/linux-like desktops.
They should be
	(filename).desktop
	(filename).directory (if Type=Directory)

filename should be "reverse dns" convention
([a-zA-Z0-9]_, but do not start with a digit

ex: if google made googledrive desktop entry:
com.google.GoogleDrive.desktop

------------------------------
-1- format
------------------------------
syntax:
	#this is a comment

	[groupname]
	field=value and spaces are included

Comments begin with a #

Blank lines are ignored

groupname: Name of a group of field=value pairs.
[Desktop Entry] is required.  Others may exist but would be ignored.
The [Desktop Entry] should be the very first non-ignored thing in the file.

fields must be [a-zA-Z0-9-]

value types are:
	string        ASCII non-control characters
	localestring  UTF-8 user-displayable
	iconstring    absolute paths or symbolic names, UTF-8
	boolean       true | false, all lower case
	numeric       must be recognized by %f of scanf in C locale

Strings support escapes:
	\s        space
	\n        new line
	\t        tab
	\r        carraige return
	\\        backslash
	\;        semicolon

multiple values are separated by semicolon

	-1.1- keys

	required:
		Type (string)
			Application
			Link
			Directory
		Name (localestring)
			Name of the application
		URL
			the url (If Type==Link)
	Others:

		Exec (string)
			commandline, can have arguments separated by space
			Must quote reserved characters
			reserved characters: space, tab, newline, \'"><~|&;$*?#()`
			Use a backslash to escape these.
			Because type is a "string", and strings also allow escaping.
			must double-escape:
			ex; \\\\
				value is a string type-> "\\"
				parse value as argument to Exec -> "\"

			Field codes: replaced when called by manager
				%f  A single file.  If multiple files selected, launch an instance per file.
				%F  A list of files. 1 instance, replace %F with a list of files.
				%u  Same as %f but URL
				%U  Same as %F but URL

		Path (string)

Type=Application
	1. Enable execution (chmod 7XX *.desktop)
	2. On Ubuntu, gnome desktop, allow launch
	   On desktop, right click the .desktop file
	   choose Allow Launching or whatever it is.
	   XFCE4 doesn't need to do this step.
	   Haven't tested any other desktop environments

Alternative?
	xfce4: can just right click desktop, "create launcher..."
	fill in some fields.
	when lauch, will say not executable etc, choose "mark executable"
