-1- SysVinit
This is the old init system.
This splits system initialization into separate run levels:

	0     poweroff.target
	1     rescue.target
	2,3,4 multi-user.target
	5     graphical.target
	6     reboot.target

The `runlevel` prints the previous and current runlevel.

On changes to the runlevel, corresponding scripts are run.
/etc/rc.local
?between 1 and 2?
