cmd is the old shell available on windows.

The command line is always parsed by the corresponding command and not
the shell.  Arguments are given to the command as a single string.  It
is up to the command itself to parse it into separate arguments.  This
means that different commands will have different behaviors when it
comes to quoting etc.
