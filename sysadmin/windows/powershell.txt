powershell is one of the shells available by default on windows.

------------------------------
-0- syntax
------------------------------
	------------------------------
	-0.1- variables
	------------------------------
	Variables are assigned with the syntax:

		$varname = value

	spaces are optional

	$varname is also used to dereference the variable
	${varname} can also be used to protect it from trailing characters.
	------------------------------
	-0.2- strings
	------------------------------
	In powershell, strings can be single or double quoted.
	Similar to bash, double quoted strings allow variable expansion while single
	quoted strings do not.

	If the "command" is a string, then the string is evaluated and
	printed (similar to the python repl)

	Only basic variables can be in strings.  Arrays, indexing, etc
	must be in a subexpr: $(indexing or array expr)
	"PS version: $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)"

	UNLIKE MOST SHELLS, backtick is the escape character, NOT BACKSLASH

	consecutive double-quotes in the context of a double-quote string will
	be interpreted as an escaped double-quote.

	consecutive single-quotes in the context of a single-quote string will
	be interpreted as an escaped single-quote.

	here-strings are like heredocs...
	@"
	herestring here
	"@

	Herestrings can be single or double quoted which behave as their corresponding
	quoting type.  Quotes inside herestrings are interpreted literally.

	Strings must be standalone, not like in bash.
	"some string"this_is_a_syntax_error
	------------------------------
	-0.3- expressions
	------------------------------
	$(some math expr)
	This allows replacing some calculation with the corresponding result.

	------------------------------
	-0.4- hashtables
	------------------------------
	$i = @{key = 'value'; key = 'value'; ...}

	Hash tables are indexed with the syntax:
	$vname.keyname.
	The braces would go around the vname only:
	${vname}.keyname


------------------------------
-1- utilities
------------------------------
	------------------------------
	-1.0- -Command
	------------------------------
	powershell -Command 'some command line'

	The command line could be separated into multiple arguments but
	the result is inconsistent, easier and more consistent to just have
	a single line.

	Note that powershell has some weird parses with the command line and quoting

	The commandline seems to be split by spaces and single quotes work as expected.
	However, double quotes DO NOT.

	double quotes are very very weird:
	* single double-quote is seemingly completely ignored.
	* double double-quote changes the remainder of the string into a single argument, followed by a space.
	* triple double-quote gets interpreted as a single double-quote
		BUT also terminates the double double-quote turning rest of the string into a single argument


	------------------------------
	-1.1- Start-Process
	------------------------------
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process?view=powershell-7.5#-argumentlist

	start a process.

	start is aliased to Start-Process on windows.

	Start-Process <program>
		-Args|-ArgumentList <str|array>
			Array is comma-delimited and can have these syntaxes:
				a,b,c...
				or @('a','b','c'...)

				NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS! inconsistent crappiness
				If using the @(), then each item MUST be quoted.
					WEIRD OBSERVATIONS:
					1. using standalone start-process, then single or double quotes are ok
					2. using powershell -c 'start-process ... ', double quotes are always discarded?!
					3. EVEN IF USING THE , SYNTAX, SPACES STILL SPLIT ARGUMENTS
					   To avoid spliting, the argument itself must contain quotes to re-quote it,
					   which means the comma syntax is terrible

			str: a string of space-delimited arguments
				The space-delimited syntax is also a bit wonky, but much more consistent and reasonable.
				'arg1 arg2 arg3'
				If an argument has a space, it must be double-quoted. (single quotes do not work!)

				in powershell:
				'arg1 arg2 "arg 3" ''arg 4''' -> ['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg 3', "'arg", "4'"]
				If an item contains double quotes, then use the escaping double quote method

				'arg1 arg2 "arg 3""" ''arg 4''' -> ['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg 3"', "'arg", "4'"]

				Because single-quotes do not work in this argument, I would recommend
				this string is a single-quote string.  Inside, use double-quote strings as needed.

			ex:
				'arg1,arg2,arg3 with space' -> ['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3', 'with', 'space']
				'arg1,arg2,''arg3 with space''' -> ['arg1', 'arg2', "\'arg3", 'with', "space'"]
