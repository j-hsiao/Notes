LVM: logical volume management

	drive: a phsyical harddrive
	partition: segment of storage on the drive
	filesystem: file storage format of a partition


	physical volume (PV): block device to store data
	                 could be:
		                 partition
		                 whole disk
		                 raid array
		                 ...
	volume group (VG): Group PV into a single logical block of storage
	                   (ex. if you have 2 2GiB drives, then net is 4
	                   a giant file would auto-split between the two.)
	logical volumes: partition the VG
