https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#dnsmasq
Not entirely sure, some sources say need dnsmasq
but others seem to say can use systemd-resolved
but it also has some kind of default?

1. ?? this might not be necessary...
	sudo pacman -S dnsmasq
	edit /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf
		[main]
		dns=dnsmasq
	sudo nmcli general reload

2.
	nm-connection-editor
	edit hotspot connection profile
		disable IPv6
	NOTE:
		I did this after installing dnsmasq and editing
		dns.conf, but not sure if it was this or that
		that made hotspot working.  I stopped before the
		reload and then deleted the conf... still works
