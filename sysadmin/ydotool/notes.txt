sudo pacman -S ydotool

On arch, ydotool does not come with a systemd ydotoold.service.
Instead just start it manually or in background.
ydotool requires access to /dev/uinput.
One way to do that is to add user to input group:
	usermod -aG input
Alternatively, start ydotoold as sudo

-2- usage
------------------------------
ydotool requires ydotoold to be running.
	ydotoold -p path/to/socket

It seems like this does not clean the socket.

From arch ydotool man page:
	You can find the key name/number your keyboard is sending to libinput by
	running `sudo libinput record` and then selecting your keyboard from the
	list it will show you the libinput proper key name and number for each
	key you press.
