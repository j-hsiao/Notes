-0- basics

Patterns match the left-most pattern, and then the longest pattern.
ex: pattern (set|setvalue)
"set or setvalue" -> set
"setvalue" -> setvalue

c
	any character matches itself (except for special characters)
\
	escape the next character.  For BRE, \ activates special meanings
	for some special characters but suppresses others.
	Also escapes some characters:
		\a: bell
		\f: form feed
		\n: newline
		\r: carriage return
		\t: tab
		\v: vertical tab
		\cx: control-x
		\dxxx: decimal value (binary)
		\o: octal value (binary)
		\b: backspace (but conflicts with above \b so excluded for sed)

		escape extensions
		\w: word
		\W: non-word
		\b: word boundary
		\B: not word-boundary
		\s: whitespace
		\S: not whitespace
		\<: word start
		\>: word end
		\`: start of pattern space (multiline, only 1st line whereas ^ is all lines)

*
	sequence of 0 or more of previous expr
.
	anything
^
	beginning if at beginning, else a ^
$
	end of line (if at end)
[list]
	"bracket expression"
	any char in list, or anything NOT in list if list prefixed with ^
	to match a -, put it at the end
	to match a ], put it at the beginning
	to match a ^, put it at the end(before the final - if it exists)
		([something-^] would mean [somethin] and then the range [g-^], so - must come after

	list may also contain character classes:
		[:alnum:] alphanumerics
		[:alpha:] alphabetical
		[:blank:] space/tab
		[:cntrl:] control characters (ascii 000-037, 177 etc)
		[:digit:] digits
		[:graph:] graphical (alnum + punct)
		[:lower:] lowercase
		[:pirnt:] printable
		[:punct:] ascii punctuation
		[:space:] space (tabs, formfeed, newlines, etc)
		[:upper:] uppercase
		[:xdigit:] hexdigits

extra metacharacters not in the original unix regex, and so require a backslash:
	\(\)
		A group
	\{n\}
		match n repetitions
	\{n,m\}
		match between n and m repetitions
	\{n,\}
		n or more repetitions
	\N
		N = int 1-9, backreference, refer to a group
	\n
		newline

Some support (but not posix):
	\|
		either or for atom before or after.
	\+
		1 or more of previous atom
	\?
		1 or none of previous atom


______________________________
-1- flavors
	______________________________
	-1.1- posix basic regular expressions (BRE)
	This is the basic regex, used by default for various tools like sed, grep, etc.

	______________________________
	-1.2- posix extended regular expressions (ERE)
	This is an extension off of unix grep and NOT BRE.  In practice, it is
	basically BRE, but metacharacters always have special meaning which is
	removed by \

	______________________________
	-1.3- perl
	perl adds some extra groups:
	(?:...) non-capturing group
	(?!...) negative lookahead
