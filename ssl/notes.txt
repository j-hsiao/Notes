-1- vocab
    CA:
        certifying authority, entity that signs certificates
        and is trusted, once CA is installed on a device
        the device will see any certificate signed by the CA
        as trustworthy
    server:
        server that clients will use, need a certificate saying
        the server is indeed that server. certificate should be
        signed by a CA, otherwise there will be a security error
        saying the site is untrustworthy
    csr:
        certificate signing request
        a request that a CA signs. The result of the signing
        is the certificate that a server uses to identify itself
        as trustworthy

-2- CA

    ______________________________
    -2.1- create a key:
        command:
            openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048
        note: create a passphrase to prevent
            someone from using your key to
            sign certificates without your
            permission)

    ______________________________
    -2.2- create a certificate:
        command:
            openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key KEY_FILE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP \
                -sha256 -days NDAYS -out CA.pem
        notes:
            NDAYS: number of days before certificate expires (non-expiring
                certificates not supported)

            answer the Common Name field, the others don't matter

______________________________
-3- signed certificates

    ______________________________
    -3.1- create a key for server
        command:
            openssl genrsa -out SOMENAME.key 2048
    
    ______________________________
    -3.2- create a csr
        command:
            openssl req -new -key KEY_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP -out SOMENAME.csr

    ______________________________
    -3.3- sign the csr:
        create a config file: name.ext
            contents:
                authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
                basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
                keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
                subjectAltName = @alt_names

                [alt_names]
                DNS.1 = name1 of server
                DNS.2 = name2 of server
            steps:
                fill in the nameX of website values
                as many as there are names for the server
        command:
            openssl x509 -req -in CSR_FILE_FROM_-3.2- -CA PEM_FROM_-2.2- \
                -CAkey KEY_FROM_-2.1- -CAcreateserial -out CERTNAME \
                -days NUMDAYS -sha256 -extfile CONFIG_FILE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP

-4- installing ca
    NOTE:
        may need to convert the CA.pem file to a CA.crt file (just change the extension)
        when adding CA certificate to windows
    ______________________________
    -4.1- chrome
        settings->advanced->manage certificates
        choose trusted root certification authorities tab
        click import import
        import the CA's cert file (-2.2-)
    -4.2- firefox
        preferences->privacy & security->security->certificates->view certificates
        import cert
