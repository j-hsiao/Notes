Cygwin incorrect wrapping
  In cygwin, if you resize the terminal while in vim, the terminal will
  not see the window change.  As a result, it will wrap incorrectly.
  (some posts say vim catches the window-change(WINCH) signal and
  redraws, but does not propagate it to the terminal)
  to fix:
    1. exit vim, resize window again
    2. kill -WINCH $$
