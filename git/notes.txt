basics
------------------------------
clone a repo
    git clone uri

checkout
    git checkout [branchname]
        checkout branch from repo (use git branch -a to see repo branches too)
    git checkout -b [newbranch]
        create/checkout branch
    git checkout [branchname] -- [path-to-filename]
        checkout file

branch
    git branch -a:
        display all branches
    git branch -d [name]
        delete branch

    
diff
    git diff -- [path-to-file]
        difference between file current and since last stage
        (so git reset if want to see dif since last commit)
    git diff --cached [commit] [--] [path]
        diff between staged changes for next commit and [commit] (defaults to head)
    git diff commit -- path
        dif between cur state and commit (not staged necessarily)
    git diff commit commit -- path
        dif between path for the two commits


reflog:
    shows hashes for previous commits/checkouts etc

reset:
    git reset --hard 'hash/string_thing'
        reset all files to state from corresponding commit
    git reset
        unstage commits

pull changes from repo (fetch & merge)
    git pull [remote] [local]
    
push changes to repo
    git push [remote] [local]

tags:
    creation:
        git tag -a [tagname] -m 'tag message/description'
    display:
        git tag -n
    pull tags:
        git fetch --tags
    push tags:
        git push origin [tagname]
