============
-0- workflow
============
General workflow

	git init
	git add ...
	git commit -m initial commit
	git branch dev
	git branch master
	git checkout dev
	... do stuff ... make commits ...
	git checkout -d
	git rebase -i master
	...squash etc
	git push . @:master
	# master is now at the ?squashed? rebase
	git checkout dev
	git merge master

result:
1. master only has full completed, ready runnable commits in its direct history
2. dev retains all the actual history


=======
-1-spec
=======
pathspecs
	rules
		paths match itself
		scope is limited to directory up to the last slash
		rest of pathspec = for pattern matching


		examples:
			d1/*.jpg
				any .jpg under d1 directory tree
				including:
					d1/im1.jpg
					d1/d2/im2.jpg

		magic signature
			short:
				:sig:pathmatcher
			long:
				:(magic,words,comma,delimited)pathmatcher

			terms:
				top      (/), pathspec is from top of git tree
				exclude  (^ or !), ignore paths
				literal  treat * and ? as literal
				icase    case insensitive


		notes:
			generally can add -- to delimit the start of pathspecs

========
refspecs
========
	format:
		[+]<src>:<dst>

		+: update even if not fast-forward
		src: source file
		dst: local file path
	example:
		git push origin master:refs/heads/master
			push local master to origin master

		git push origin :refs/heads/master
			push nothing (delete) origin master


=====
other
=====
	tags:
		refs/tags/<tagname>
	heads:
		refs/heads/<headname>

	relative:
	  HEAD~n  (go back n commits)
	  HEAD^n  (go to nth parent (if merge, multiple parents))




==========
-2- basics
==========
	======================
	-2.1- reference syntax
	======================
		https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions
		<sha1>
			the sha1 (eg. from git log) or unique leading substring
		<refname>
			[refs/[tags/|heads/|remotes/]]<branch/tagname>[/HEAD]
		heads
			HEAD              current commit
			FETCH_HEAD        branch from which last fetch
			ORIG_HEAD         HEAD before git merge, rebase, reset, etc
			MERGE_HEAD        commits merged into current HEAD
			REBASE_HEAD       current HEAD during a stopped rebase due to conflicts
			REVERT_HEAD       revert target during git revert
			CHERRY_PICK_HEAD  cherry-picking target during git cherry-pick
			BISECT_HEAD       current commit to be tested during git bisect --no-checkout
			AUTO_MERGE
		[refname]@[{thing}]
			refname:
				defaults to HEAD if omitted, or current branch
			thing:
				date:
					yesterday
					N month N weeks N days N hour N second ago
					YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS
				index:
					indexth prior reference
					If negative, indicate prior checked-out commit
					?? what's the difference ??
				[^n]*
					n defaults to 1 if absent.
					Take the nth parent (merges, have multiple parents)
					example:
					A^^2 -> take A's 1st parent, and then that's 2nd parent
				~n
					n defaults to 1 if absent
					go back n generations, choosing the 1st parent

	=====================
	-2.2- common commands
	=====================
		=============
		-2.2.1- clone
		=============
			clone a repo
				git clone uri
		===========
		-2.2.2- add
		===========
			add
				git add <files>
		==============
		-2.2.3- commit
		==============
			commit
				git commit -m 'message'

				git commit --fixup <commit>
					fix the commit and keep its message
				git commit --squash <commit>
					merge commits into a single commit and specify final message after merge with rebase -i

				protip:
					use HEAD for commit

		================
		-2.2.4- checkout
		================
			checkout
				git checkout [branchname]
					checkout branch from repo (use git branch -a to see repo branches too)
				git checkout -b [newbranch]
					create/checkout branch
				git checkout [branchname] -- [path-to-filename]
					checkout file
				git checkout --detach [target]
					checkout the given commit, do not attack to any branches etc.
		==============
		-2.2.5- branch
		==============
			branch
				git branch -a:
					display all branches
				git branch -d [name]
					delete branch
		============
		-2.2.6- diff
		============
			diff
				git diff -- [path-to-file]
					difference between file current and since last stage
					(so git reset if want to see dif since last commit)
				git diff --cached [commit] [--] [path]
					diff between staged changes for next commit and [commit] (defaults to head)
				git diff commit -- path
					dif between cur state and commit (not staged necessarily)
				git diff commit commit -- path
					dif between path for the two commits
		==============
		-2.2.7- reflog
		==============
			reflog:
				shows hashes for previous commits/checkouts etc
		=============
		-2.2.8- reset
		=============
			reset:
				(reset current branch (if applicable) to the ref)
				NOTE: reflog may still point to commits so will not be able to prune
				git reset --hard 'hash/string_thing'
					reset all files to state from corresponding commit (delete files too)
				git reset
					unstage commits (keep files the same)
		============
		-2.2.9- pull
		============
			pull changes from repo (fetch & merge)
				git pull [remote] [local]
		=============
		-2.2.10- push
		=============
			push changes to repo
				git push <remote> <localbranch>[:remotebranch]

				can leave localbranch blank to delete remotebranch.

			NOTE1:
				when pushing, the target branch must NOT be checked out

			NOTE2:
				It is possible to push to a branch on the current repo
				by using . as the remote
					ex: git push . somebranch:otherbranch
				This is only allowed if otherbranch is not checked out in accordance
				to NOTE1 AND if the push would be a fast-forward.
		============
		-2.2.11- tag
		============
			there are 2 types of tags:
				lightweight
					(no -a, -s, -m options)
				annotated
					has a message and is a true git object
			creation:
				git tag -a <tagname> -m 'tag message/description' [sha]
					if no sha, then use HEAD
				(add -f to change tag commit if already exist)
			deletion:
				local:
					git tag -d <tagname>
				remote:
					git push origin :tagname
					git push origin :refs/tags/tagname
					git push origin --delete <tagname>
			display:
				git tag
				git tag -n
				git tag -l "pattern*"
			pull tags:
				git fetch --tags
			push tags:
				git push origin --tags
				git push origin <tagname>

==========
-3- rebase
==========
	"reapply commits on top of another base tip"

	git rebase [--onto commit] <upstream> [branch]

		branch: git checkout branch if given before rebase
		upstream: indicate the commits to transplant (from HEAD to intersection with upstream, does not the intersection)

			example:
				if upstream == HEAD~2, then this indicates HEAD~1 and HEAD


		onto: location to plop commits onto (defaults to upstream)



	example:
		first-----a-----b-------c master
		 \
		  d-----e feature

		git checkout feature
		git rebase master

		first-----a-----b-------c master
		                         \
		                          d-----e feature

	if conflict, can git rebase --abort to cancel rebase

	interactive rebase
		pick commits to rebase and fixup, squash, or pick

===========
-4- history
===========
	-4.1- git reflog: history of what actually happened
	            (includes reset, rebase, etc)

		expire: expire reflog entries (dangling commits will then be able to be pruned)
			--expire-unreachable=<time>
			--expire=<time>
				(can use "now" for time)

			--all
				(dunno bout this, but need this to cause reflogs to dangling commits to be removed)

	-4.2- git log: history traversing parent commits
		general tips:
			git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
				(adog)

		options:
			<paths>                           show commits that modified the <paths> given
			--all                             use all /refs and HEAD
			--decorate[=short|full|auto|no]   show ref names (branches, tags, etc), defaults to short
			-<number> | -n <number>           limit to <number> commits
			-[after|before]=<date>            after or before the date
			--abbrev-commit                   show unique part of commit SHAs
			--oneline                         same as --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
			--graph                           draw graph

=========
-5- alias
=========

git config [--global | --local] alias.<aliascommand> "command and args"

example:
	git config --local alias.graph "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"
	git config --local --unset alias.graph

=================
-6- miscellaneous
=================
	-6.1- line endings
		global:
			git config core.autocrlf
		per repo:
			.gitattributes file (must be in root directory)
		by file:
			.git/info/attributes

			pattern attr attr attr...
			attr:
				attrname: set the attr
				-attrname: unset the attr
				attrname=val: set to value
				unspecified: not specified... (no matches or not in .gitattributes)

			later lines override previous lines
			must be in repo root
			example:
				* text=auto
				*.c text
				*.h text
				*.sln text eol=crlf
				*.sh text eol=lf
				*.png binary
				*.jpg binary

	-6.2- gitignore
		.gitignore file per directory: all users will ignore
		.git/info/exclude: exclude only for this checked-out repo
		ignores matched files

		#: comment (can escape with \)
		trailing spaces can be escaped with \ else ignored
		! : negates pattern
		/ at beginning or middle, then it is relative
		otherwise, matches anything in subdirectories as well
		end with /: directories only
		*: anything except /
		?: any single char ecxept /
		[a-zA-Z] single char in range
		**:
			**/: in all directories
			/**: everything inside dir (infinite depth)
			a/**/b: any b under some ancestor a
	=========
	-6.3- ssh
	=========
	See remotehost/ssh/notes.txt for key generation, git prefers ed25519 type?
	put .pub file contents onto git account
	edit ${HOME}/.ssh/config
	  HOST host-to-use-on-command-line
	    HOSTNAME actual-host-name-eg-github.com
	    USER git
	    IDENTITYFILE path/to/private/key
	    IDENTITIESONLY yes
	git clone host-to-use-on-command-line:<git-user>/<reponame>.git
	(uses ~/.ssh/config to choose private key)


===============
-7- usage notes
===============
usage method one:

features:

	master     a-b-c          h
	                 \       / \
	feature 1         d-e-f-g  feature2 ...
	                        |
	                     deleted
	code:
		git init
		git checkout -b feature1
		...work on feature1...
		git checkout master
		git merge --squash feature1
		git branch -d feature1
		git checkout -b feature2
		...work on feature2...


dev branch
	master     a         f
	            \       / \
	dev          b c d e   g

	code:
		git init
		git checkout -b dev
		...work on dev...
		git checkout master
		git merge dev --squash??
		git checkout dev
		git merge master
		...continue working on dev...


features: useful for cleaner history
dev: separte from master features/versions
	...although...
	can just git tag instead of have master branch with only versions...
	(in other words, dev branch is useless?)
git tags = your "main" branch with only fully functioning versions

overall usage probably like this:
master: version X.X...
	squash merge dev branch followed by merge master back into dev to sync the branches
dev: branch off "feature" branches
	feature branches get merged (squash? maybe maybe not) into dev
	delete (or maybe not?) the feature branch

saw a note that seems agreeable:
	if release are always chronological, master branch is fine
	if not, (ie 1.0.1 can come after 1.1.0), then tagging may be a better approach
	or maybe separate release branches per version...
=================
-8- authorization
=================
git and bitbucket do not allow username/password anymore:
	bitbucket:
		OAuth2: see bboauth.py for bitbucket oauth method.
		app password:
			go to personal settings, app passwords
			create an app password (only shown 1 time, select permissions, etc)
			when using app password, use the username, NOT EMAIL
			username is under general->account settings
	git: create a token and use that as password instead

==========
-9- config
==========
general usage:
git config [--system | --global | --local] [-e | [--unset] <name> [value] | --list ]
	system: all repos for all users
	global: all repos for (current user only) (${HOME}/.gitconfig)
	local: current repo only

	use the settings from the most specific scope

	-e: edit the config file
	--unset: remove the variable
	--list: list all variables in the config file for corresponding scope
	<name>: print the current value
	<name> <value>: set the current value

	list all possible config keys:
		git help [--config|-c]

	useful settings:
		core.attributesFile
			path to global gitattributes file
		core.autocrlf:
			auto conversion between crlf and lf on windows (always lf on unix)
		core.safecrlf:
			checks that conversion between crlf/lf is reversible (if file has both
			then not reversible)
		credential.helper
			name is "credential-<name>"
			git config value is just '<name> [options]'
			list all helpers installed:
				git help -a | grep credential-
			builtin helpers:
				cache: cache for short period of time
					options:
						--timeout seconds
						--socket path
					other:
						git credential-cache exit: clear cache(close daemon)
				store: store forever
				manager-core: opensource builtin to git for windows
==========
-10- stash
==========
	git stash [push]
		temporary save changes but no commits
		useful options (requires push to be present, otherwise no args allowed (except -p)):
			-u  include untracked files
			-a  all
			-m  message
	git stash list:
		show current stashes
	git stash show:
		show changes
	git pop
		pop a stash state and apply it
	git stash apply
		apply changes
	git stash branch <branchname>
		makes a branch identical to state when git stash was created
	git stash clear
		remove all stash entries
	git stash create
		create a stash entry
==========
-11- clean
==========
	git clean
		removes any untracked files (like build products etc)
	-d: also check untracked directories
	-f: force (like rm -f)
	-i: interactive (like rm -i)
	-n|--dry-run: just list what would be removed
	-x: include files that were .gitignored
	-X: ONLY include files that were .gitignored
=========
-12- show
=========
	shows objects
	show:
		tag: tag message and obj
		trees: names
		blobs(files): contents
			branch/commit:filepath
===========
-13- remote
===========
	show remotes
	git remote set-url --push: add a separate push remote
		(no command to separately set a pull url)
==============
-14- submodule
==============
	sub git directories.
	git submodule [cmd]
		add <repo> [path]
		init [path]
		deinit (--all| <path>)
		update [path]
			NOTE: for initial update on windows (git submodule init; git
				submodule update) if the submodule requires a password, you need
				to use git-bash or it will error saying permission denied.  An
				alternative is to just git clone directly into the submodule dir
				and then use absorbgitdirs
		foreach <command>
			available vars:
				$name             name of submodule
				$sm_path          path from root git dir
				$displaypath      relative path
				$sha1             sha1 of submodule
				$toplevel         abs path to root git dir
			command should be a single bash command line.
			(even on windows, since it uses git-bash)
			-q will prevent the "Entering $displaypath" message per submodule.
		absorbgitdirs [path...]
			move submodule .git directories into root git dir's .git/modules
			and replace submodule .git with a file pointing to corresponding
			dir.
===========
-15- server
===========
	simple serve git repos:
		bare repo:
			cd /root
			git clone --bare <project>
			cd <project>
			git --bare update-server-info
			mv hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update
			start a server at /root

		non-bare repo:
			same steps as bare
			except remove --bare tag
			start server IN THE REPO DIR
			you will need to pull .git and rename it.
			eg:
				git clone project
				cd project
				git update-server-info
				cp .git/hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update
				py -m http.server
				git clone http://localhost:8000/.git project
==========
-16- blame
==========
git blame filename
Like less, except add which commit/user last changed that line.

===========
-17- bisect
===========
Use binary search to find a target commit.  This is usually done
to find a commit that introduced a bug.
Example:
	bad -> points to a bad commit (has bug)
	good -> the commit of a good commit (no bug)
	git bisect start
	git bisect bad bad
	git bisect good good
	# git auto-checks out a commit between bad and good
	git bisect good|bad
	# as needed and git will auto-checkout
	# the next binary pivot point until reached a single commit
	git bisect reset

NOTE:
	old/new can be used in place of good/bad, meaning still the same
