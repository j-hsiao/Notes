		Type                    Notify that service startup has finished.
			simple                  immediately after fork
			exec                    After binary is executed (after fork AND execve)
			forking                 discouraged
			oneshot                 After main process exits
			dbus                    Must have BusName=, up after BusName is acquired
			notify                  after send READY=1 via sd_notify
			notify-reload           same as notify, but when get SIGHUP,
			                        sd_notify RELOADING=1, MONOTONIC_USEC= (like clock_gettime)
			                        then lastly, READY=1
			idle
		RestartSec              Sleep time after ending before restart.
		                        Unitless seconds (90 for 90 seconds) or timespan (5min 2s 3ms)
		RestartSteps            Number of steps to increment restart delay up to the max. 0=off
		RestartMaxDelaySec      The max restart delay.  "infinity" to disable.
		ExecStart               Commands to execute.  Type=oneshot can have multiple
		                        Otherwise, must have exactly 1.
		                        Can be prefixed with a - to ignore failures and

	-1.2- Unit
		Description             short description, human readable
		Documentation           space-separated list of URIs
		Wants                   space-separated weak dependencies
		                        or just specify multiple times
		Requires                Same as Wants, but strong dependency
		Before/After            Must start before or after given
		                        space-separated services
		StartLimitBurst         restart count threshold
		StartLimitIntervalSec   if StartLimitBurst restarts within
		                        interval, then stop trying to restart
		                        forever.

		WantedBy                list of unit names to add this as a dependency.
		  /RequiredBy           Usually use the run level to start at:
		  /UpheldBy               0: runlevel0.target, poweroff.target
		                          1: runlevel1.target, rescue.target
		                          2,3,4: runlevel[2|3|4].target, multi-user.target
		                          5: runlevel5.target, graphical.target
                              6: runlevel6.target, reboot.target
