  a "screen" = instance of a screen process (like a vim instance)
  a "window" = a subsession (like an edited file)
  a "region" = a region on the monitor (like a vim split)
    multiple regions can use the same window
______________________________
-1- commandline options
  -list
  -S <name>     set a name for the screen to create/reconnect to
  -r            reconnect to a session
  -R            reconnect/create if not exist
  -d            detach any currently connected sessions
  -D            detach and logout remotely (use this if
                sshed into a server and used screen to ensure the
                ssh connection knows it's disconnected.
  -d -m         start a detached screen session
  -e xy         x = ^<some key>, y = (generally), that same key
                example:
                  -e ^Jj (use Control-j instead of Control-a)
                  use C-j j to send control-j to the terminal
                The default is ^Aa.
                (Being capitalized seems to not affect whether
                the binding is valid or not, ^A still activates
                with C-a without holding shift.)
                setting it to ^Jj may be better because on command
                line, C-a is "go to beginning of line" while C-j
                is unused.

  all controls are prefixed with Control-a
