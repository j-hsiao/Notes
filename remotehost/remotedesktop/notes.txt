	______________________________
	-1.1- setup/startup
		HOST:
			sudo apt install xfce4-session tigervnc-standalone-server xfce4-goodies
			edit ~/.vnc/xstartup:
				unset SESSION_MANAGER
				unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
				startxfce4
		CLIENT:
			sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer
			vncviewer host:port [-passwd pathtofile]
				(if -passwd omitted, then enter password)

		______________________________
		-1.1.1- blank screen/screensaver issue
			After a period of inactivity, the virtual screen might be turned
			off.  When this happens, connecting and moving the mouse does not
			seem to turn it back on.  As a result, the screen is just left black
			with no response.
			Possible solutions:
				1. uninstall power management
				   sudo apt remove xfce4-power-manager-*
				2. ssh and try:
				   xset dpms force on

	______________________________
	-1.2- Usage
		HOST:
			creating:
				vncserver:
					-localhost
						yes|no        explicitly specify yes/no to only localhost
						              default is yes.  This is mainly for security.
						              The port can be ssh-tunneled and then the server
						              can be accessed via ssh.
					-NeverShared    Do not share the screen, only 1 user at a time.
					                You will be kicked off if someone else connects.

			managing:
				vncserver:
					-list:          list the current sessions.
						:number|:*    list specified session
					-kill
						:number|:*    kill the vnc specified vnc session.
						-dry-run      don't actually kill
						-verbose      more verbose
						-clean        also clean log files
				vncpasswd:
					Prompt you for a password and maybe a view-only password too.

		CLIENT:
			vncviewer:
				[user@][host][:port]  Connect to specified vnc server.

-2- xrdp
	______________________________
	-2.1-
		sudo apt install xrdp

		edit /etc/srdp/startwm.sh
		+ startxfce4
			  test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
			  exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession

		might have to:
			service xrdp status
			service xrdp start

		xrdp uses port 3389,
		but ssh tunnel attempts failed, something about already have a console session.
