various vnc server types:
	xvnc
	vino
	tigervnc
	tightvnc



tigervnc
	(Use f8 for context menu to fullscreen etc)

	tigervnc [options...] [user[@host]:display]
	-localhost <yes|no>
		only allow connections from localhost. The connection to remote
		would then be handled by ssh or something like that.
		(see ssh/notes -1.3- forwarding)

		(newest versions seem to default to yes)
	-NeverShared
		do not share screen (you can know if someone else logged in)
	-kill [[user@]host][:display#|:*]
		kills desktop
	-clean
		also removes logfile for that display
	-list
		list running tigervnc displays

	NOTE: sometimes, starting a vncserver and connecting to it will just
		result in a blank screen. In this case, xfce4 seems to have good
		success rate:
		apt install xfce4-session.  Then add/edit the file:
			~/.vnc/xstartup: uncomment the lines for "normal desktop"
				instead of xinitrc, replace with startxfce4
				ie:

					# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
					#unset SESSION_MANAGER
					#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

					becomes

					# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
					unset SESSION_MANAGER
					unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
					#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
					startxfce4

		install xfce4 xfce4-terminal
		(gnome-terminal ignores :display and puts window in wrong x server)

	set password:
		vncpasswd

	connect to display:
		vncviewer <:display#> options

	summary:

		startup:
			on host:
				sudo apt install xfce4-session tigervnc-standalone-server xfce4-goodies
				edit ~/.vnc/xstartup:
					unset SESSION_MANAGER
					unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
					startxfce4
				vncserver -localhost -NeverShared
					(may need to add a password first)
			on client:
				sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer
				vncviewer host:port -passwd pathtofile
					(if -passwd omitted, then enter password)
		shutdown:
			on host:
				vncserver -list
				vncserver -kill :displaynum
		password:
			vncpasswd

		NOTE:
			can also ssh tunnel (ssh -L localport:localhost:vncserverport

xrdp
	windows can connect via "remote destop connection" (no extra installs)
	(xrdp apparently wraps vnc... so same gnome-terminal issue exists with
	same solution)  This uses the computer's user/password combo

	add startxfce4 in /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh before xsession:
		+ startxfce4
			test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
			exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession
