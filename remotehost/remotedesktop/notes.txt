various vnc server types:
  xvnc
  vino
  tigervnc
  tightvnc



tigervnc
  tigervnc [options...] [user[@host]:display]
  -localhost <yes|no>
    only allow connections from localhost. The connection to remote
    would then be handled by ssh or something like that.
    (see ssh/notes -1.3- forwarding)

    (newest versions seem to default to yes)
  -NeverShared
    do not share screen (you can know if someone else logged in)
  -kill [[user@]host][:display#|:*]
    kills desktop
  -clean
    also removes logfile for that display
  -list
    list running tigervnc displays

  start a desktop in vnc
  ~/.vnc/xstartup:
    uncomment the lines for "normal desktop"
    instead of xinitrc, replace with startxfce4
    ie:

      # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
      #unset SESSION_MANAGER
      #exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

      becomes

      # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
      unset SESSION_MANAGER
      #exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
      startxfce4

    install xfce4 xfce4-terminal
    (gnome-terminal ignores :display and puts window in wrong x server)

  set password:
    vncpasswd

  connect to display:
    vncviewer <:display#> options


xrdp
  windows can connect via "remote destop connection" (no extra installs)
  (xrdp apparently wraps vnc... so same gnome-terminal issue exists with
  same solution)  This uses the computer's user/password combo

  add startxfce4 in /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh before xsession:
    + startxfce4
      test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
      exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession
