-0- ssh tunneling
	The client can be ssh tunneled to the remote server to encrypt the
	connection or bypass firewalls etc.
	Command:

		ssh user@host -L [local net]:(localport):(net on remote server):(remoteport) -f sleep 10 && vncviewer ...

	Usually, net (both local and remote) will be "localhost".
	"localport" is the port used at the local/client machine.
	"remoteport" is the port used at the remote/host machine.

	The -f will have the tunnel run in background and the sleep will make
	it run for a few seconds.  vncviewer should connect before the tunnel is
	closed.  The tunnel will last until vncviewer closes the connection.

	For more info, see notes at "/remotehost/ssh/notes.txt" section -1.3-

-1- tigervnc
	______________________________
	-1.1- setup/startup
		HOST:
			Run commands:
				sudo apt install xfce4-session tigervnc-standalone-server xfce4-goodies

			Edit ~/.vnc/xstartup:
				unset SESSION_MANAGER
				unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
				startxfce4
		CLIENT:
			sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer
			vncviewer host:port [-passwd pathtofile]
				(if -passwd omitted, then enter password)

		______________________________
		-1.1.1- blank screen/screensaver issue
			After a period of inactivity, the virtual screen might be turned
			off.  When this happens, connecting and moving the mouse does not
			seem to turn it back on.  As a result, the screen is just left black
			with no response.
			Possible solutions:
				1. Run commands (needs a DISPLAY value)

				   xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/blank-on-ac -s 0
				   xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/dpms-on-ac-off -s 0
				   xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/dpms-on-ac-sleep -s 0

				   The settings seem to persist, so only need to set this once.

				2. topleft applications->settings->power manager -> display tab
				   Turn all to never.
			Failed solutions:
				1. uninstall power management
				   sudo apt remove xfce4-power-manager-*
				2. ssh and try:
				   xset dpms force on

	______________________________
	-1.2- Usage
		HOST:
			creating:
				vncserver:
					-localhost
						yes|no        explicitly specify yes/no to only localhost
						              default is yes.  This is mainly for security.
						              The port can be ssh-tunneled and then the server
						              can be accessed via ssh.
					-NeverShared    Do not share the screen, only 1 user at a time.
					                You will be kicked off if someone else connects.

			managing:
				vncserver:
					-list:          list the current sessions.
						:number|:*    list specified session
					-kill
						:number|:*    kill the vnc specified vnc session.
						-dry-run      don't actually kill
						-verbose      more verbose
						-clean        also clean log files
				vncpasswd:
					Prompt you for a password and maybe a view-only password too.

		CLIENT:
			vncviewer:
				[user@][host][:port]  Connect to specified vnc server.

-2- xrdp
	______________________________
	-2.1-
		sudo apt install xrdp

		edit /etc/srdp/startwm.sh
		+ startxfce4
			  test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
			  exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession

		might have to:
			service xrdp status
			service xrdp start

		xrdp uses port 3389,
		but ssh tunnel attempts failed, something about already have a console session.
