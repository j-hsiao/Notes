-1- ssh
    ssh user@domain
    ssh -l user domain
    ______________________________
    -1.1- config
        config files:
            /etc/ssh/ssh_config
            ~/.ssh/config
        Host name
            HostName ip/domain
            User defaultUser
            IdentityFile path/to/file
            Port <port number>
            other options
    _______________________________
    -1.2- encryption/keys
        ssh-keygen -t type -b bits -f file -C comment -n ""
        rsa:
            generates an rsa and rsa.pub file
            put the rsa.pub file in the target host
            ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            when sshing use the rsa file to the -i argument
    ______________________________
    -1.3- forwarding
      ssh can perform port forwarding via ssh tunneling
      adds ssh security to the connection... (at least for
      the segment between the 2 machines)

      Forward from client to ssh host
        ssh -L [<localhost>]:<localport>:<remotehost>:<remoteport>
          bind a socket to <localhost>:<localport> which forwards data
          to <remotehost>:<remoteport>

      Forward from ssh host to client
        ssh -R [remotehost]:<remoteport>:<localhost>:<localport>
          ssh to the remote machine, and create a socket bound to
            <remotehost>:<remoteport> which forward traffic to
            <localhost>:<localport>
