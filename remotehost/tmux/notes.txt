	-0.0- terminology
	------------------------------
	Session: A collection of windows.

	Window: a "space" that takes the entire "screen"
	        The terminal can only display a single window at a time.

	Pane: A splitting of a "Window"

	Key sequence: A sequence of keys that generally activate a command
	              binding.  Key sequences will be separated by a space.
	              A dash will indicate combination with a modifier key.
	              Example: "C-b [" means press control+b and then [.

	Prefix key: Tmux uses a prefix key to activate all bindings.
	            The prefix key will be omitted unless otherwise stated.
