-0- terminology
------------------------------
Session: A collection of windows.

Window: a "space" that takes the entire "screen"
        The terminal can only display a single window at a time.

Pane: A splitting of a "Window"

Key sequence: A sequence of keys that generally activate a command
              binding.  Key sequences will be separated by a space.
              A dash will indicate combination with a modifier key.
              Example: "C-b [" means press control+b and then [.

Prefix key: Tmux uses a prefix key to activate all bindings.
            The prefix key will be omitted unless otherwise stated.
