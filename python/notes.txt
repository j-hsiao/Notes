------------------------------
=1= modules
------------------------------
modules contain __init__.py
imports can be relative
  from . import something
  from .. import something

note, for runtime imports, use __import__:
  __import__(name, globals={}, locals={}, fromlist=[], level=-1):
    globals: determine context (subpackages etc)
    locals: unused
    fromlist: list of names (emulate from name import ...)
              or empty list (import name)
              NOTE: should be list with empty name: ['']
                if want to import something like 'mod.rt'
    level: -1: both relative and absolute
            0: absolute
           >0: # of parent directories to search relative to cur mod


for running files inside a module (might use absolute imports)
use python -m module.submodule
ex:
workingdir = /home

/home
        /mymod
                /submodir
                    bar.py
                foo.py
want to run  mymod/foo.py

in foo.py:
    from mymod.submodir import bar

python mymod/foo.py => error, no module named mymod
    (because import dir for foo.py is then set to its dir)

instead run:
python -m mymod.foo

------------------------------
=2= context manager
------------------------------
used in with statement
should have __enter__() and __exit__(exceptionType, exceptionValue, traceback)

    __enter__():
        return an item to be bound by the with statement
        with manager as f:   ->    f = manager.__enter__()
    __exit__(exceptionType, exceptionValue, traceback):
        all None if no exception
        return a Truthy value to indicate exception was handled and should not be raised
------------------------------
=3= closure
------------------------------
closures:
    define functions within a function
    and call the outer function to get the inner function
    the inner function has access to variables
    from within the outer function
    (but anything else cannot access them directly anyways)

uses:
    make things more "private" within python
    speed
        speed increases are cited as:
            no "bound method" creation
            closure locals access is faster than self
            no dict access (have to hash keys etc)

        testing results:

        using simple class with an accessor method times are:
        (repeat 100, number 100)
        class implementation
                class                       closure

            __init__(self, value):      __init__(self, value):
                self._x = value             self.x = self.closure(value)
            def x(self):                def closure(self, value):
                return self._x              return lambda : value


        ______________________________
        python2
                                class               closure
        loading                 0.0004201           0.0004189
        instantiation           1.5974e-05          3.7909e-05
        calls                   7.8678e-06          6.9141e-06


        analysis:
            (load is just a 1-time thing across all objects so it is ignored)
            instantiation:      -2.2e-05
            calls:              +0.95e-6

            break-even:         ~23.15 accesses??

        conclusion:
            if object accesses self < 23 (very short-lived), using normal class with self is faster
            if object accesses self > 23 (long-lived), wrapping internals in closures is faster

        analysis:

            instantiation:      -2.37e-05
            calls:              +1.06e-06

            break-even:         ~22.35 accesses
        conclusion:
            same conclusion as above
    NOTES:
        loading: creation of the class (importing a file)
        instantiation: creating an instance of the class
        calls: calling functions/accessing members of the class

summary, closure compared to object classes:
                    python2                     python3
    memory:         closure uses more           closure uses less
    loading:        closure is slower           closure is faster
    instantiation   closure is slower           closure is slower
    calls           closure is faster           closure is faster

    if object is instantiated and then tossed without much use,
    use object class, otherwise wrapping class internals
    in closures is faster

    memory use is about the same, but if a large number of objects are being created,
    python3 closures are more memory efficient, but python2, closures are less memory efficient


______________________________
=4= memoryview
    memoryview: view of memory without copies
                much more efficient
                bytes-like
                has some issues between python2/3

                                                    python2             python3
    b''.join()                                      X                   O
    memoryview(nparray)                             O                   O

=5= decorator

    decorator: take a func
        return a new func

    functools.wraps
        adds the original function's docstrings to the wrapped function

    class can have a decorator as a method
    but decorator can't be called directly
    ie:
        class name(super):
            def decorator(func):
                def decorated(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    do stuff
                return decorated
                
            @decorator
            def func(self, stuff):
                do stuff


    examples:
        ____________________
        example1:
            def bye(func):
                @wraps(func)
                def f(*args, **kwargs):
                    return func(*args, **kwargs) + ', bye.'
                return f

            @bye
            def somefunc(name):
                return 'hello {}'.format(name)

        ____________________
        example2: decorator just needs to be a function, can be the return of a function call
            def appender(text):
                def dec(func):
                    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
                        return ', '.join([func(*args, **kwargs), text])

            @appender('bye')
            def somefunc(name):
                return 'hello {}'.format(name)
            
        ____________________
        example 3: conditional decorator
            def conditional_decorate(decorator, boo):
                return lambda func : decorator(func) if boo else func

            @conditional_decorator(bye, True)
            def somefunc(arg):
                return arg
            
______________________________
=6= super
  super can be used to reach the next class in MRO of self
  NOTE: super does not necessarily imply inherited class:
  class a(object):
    pass
  class b(object):
    pass
  class c(a, b):
    pass

  MRO = c, a, b, object

  in a, super could be object (if runtime-type is a) or b(if runtime type is c)
  so if whatever function you are accessing via super takes different args
  there will be an error
  ie:
    a.__init__(self, arg1, arg2):
      super(a, self).__init__() # might or might not be object.__init__
    b.__init__(self, arg1):
      pass

    if isinstance(self, c), then the super call in a WILL error out

  that's why:
    when using super:
      all functions must have same signature:
      (generally take only kwargs, kwargs should be mutually exclusive)

  super is only helpful in diamond problem
    in this example, if both a and b call object.__init__
    then c calls a.__init__ and b.__init__ directly,
    object.__init__ is called twice
    note: object.__init__ does nothing so in this case not important
    but if object was some other class, then it's significant

  using super will only call each __init__ once
    but a class cannot assume which class's __init__ is being called

  side remark:
    this is why MixIns generally inherit from object only
      no diamond problem, (object doesn't really count)
