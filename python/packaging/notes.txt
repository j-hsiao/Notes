  Modules are created with distutils:
  ______________________________
  terms
    pure python module: a .py file
    extension module:   a shared lib (.so, .pyd, ...)
    package:            a dir of modules

  others:
    wheel format:
      1. setuptools, not distutils
      2. pip install wheel
      (or pip install build and then python -m build)

      This creates a wheel(built) and a tar.gz/zip (source) dist files.

-1- setup.py
  ______________________________
  -1.1- writing setup.py
    NOTE: windows python2.7 testing, seems everything MUST be below
      the setup.py directory.  It seems to copy everything into a
      temp dir and then do the install.  As a result, using a ..
      path causes the dir to not be found.  os.getcwd() is also the
      temp dir so no way to get the original dir.
      __init__.py is always added if it exists and any py file is
      added within the same dir.  (MANIFEST.in exclude command
      does not exclude the __init__.py from being added)


    import distutil
    from distutils.core import setup
      or
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(...)
      kwargs:
        py_modules=[...]
          list of python modules (module notation, not file)
          These are the names that you would use when importing it
          post-install.  The default is to search in the same dir
          as the setup.py.  The search dirs can be modified with the
          package_dir argument below.  There is NO need to add the 
          the __init__.py modules.  __main__.py WILL require adding
          explicitly here (unless you use packages instead)
        packages=[...]
          Similar to py_modules, but list the packages instead.  Any .py
          files IMMEDIATELY under these packages will be added.  NO SUB
          PACKAGES WILL BE PROCESSED.  These must be listed separately.
        package_dir={'install_package_name': 'source_directory'}
          package: dirname, an empty package = the "root" package,
          prefixed to all packages.
        ext_modules: [distutils.core.Extension(...),...]
          Extension('name', ['source... filenames'])
            swig_opts=['',...]
              swig options to use swig (.i) files
            include_dirs=[''...]
              include directories for compilation
            define_macros=[(name,value),...]
              macros to define:
                '#define {0} {1}'.format(tup).
                '#define {0}' if tup[1] is None
            undef_macros['',...]
              macros to undef
        ext_package='name'
          prefix package for all ext_modules
        libraries=['',...]
          libraries to link to

          directories for link libraries.

          recompile if any of these change.

          'name[<!=>version,...]
          NOTE:
            for setuptools' setup(), install_requires may be preferred.
            when built with install_requires, pip will actually install
            these requirements when installing the wheel.  Note:
            using python setup.py install doesn't check python version
            and will result in trying to install incompatible versions.
            Using pip install . actually does those checks.  If using
            install_requires, then using pip is preferred.
        provides=['',...]
          python module/package
          'pkg' or 'pkg (major.minor)'
        obsolete=['',...]
          same format as provides
        scripts=['',...]
          list of python scripts to install
        package_data={'pkgname':'glob'}
          list of package data files
        data_files=[('installdir', ['fnames'...])...]
          extra files to install as is

-5- setuptools (enhanced distutils)

-6- namespace packages
  see also pep420 (for python3.3+)

  in namespace:
    __init__.py:
      from pkgutil import extend_path
      __path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)

  recommended to have structure:
    setup.py
    root_package_or_namespace
      subpackages
      ...
  (pip install -e seems to require this structure)

  sidenotes:
    if python2, then namespace packages require that __init__.py
    which imports from pkgutil. However, because pip installs
    it all into the same dir, the __init__.py can clash.  The result
    is uninstalling one of the packages removes the __init__.py
    that makes the namespace into a namespace package.  As a result
    all the other things cannot be used anymore.
    eg:
      dir1
        namespace
          __init__.py
          pkg1
            __init__.py
            f1.py
      dir2
        namespace
          __init__.py
          pkg2
            __init__.py
            f2.py

      when installing as wheel, namespace will be installed as the
      same directory., dir1/namespace/__init__.py clashes with
      dir2/namespace/__init__.py.  As a result, if install dir1 and dir2
      and then uninstall any of them, namespace/__init__.py will be removed.
      As a result, the one that is still installed can no longer be used.

    Because of this, for python < 3.3 namespace packages, I'd probably recommend
    doing python setup.py install (uses egg, so each dist gets own dir).
    This allows them all to be independently installed.
    for python>=3.3, using pip is fine thanks to implicit namespace packages
