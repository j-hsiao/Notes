python3 differences...

bytes still bytes
str->bytes
unicode->str


import system
... welp, testing __package__ doesn't really seem to do anything much...
maybe because it's automatically set? dunno

anyways, simply put:
no more:
/pack
        /submod1
        /subpack
                /submod2

in submod1:
bad:
    import subpack  
    from subpack import submod2
change to:
    from . import subpack
    from .subpack import submod2
